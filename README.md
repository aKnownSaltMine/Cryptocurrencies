# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to take the large amount of cryptocurrencies that are currently on the market and break them down into classification groups so as to be better digestible for investment portfolios. In order to do this, unsupervised Machine Learning was used in order to better classify the data using the `KMeans` algorithm. The data was cleaned then preprocessed to prepare it for the ML algorithm using `PCA`. After the groups were clustered, the overall data was then plotted in both a 3d scatter model and 2d scatter model using `hvplot`.
